# ALizarazoTellez's Lang Script

This script extracts audio and subtitles from the current stream. It requires `ffmpeg`.

It was created to help me learn English.

## Configuration

- `enabled`: Enables or disables the script.
- `mining_directory`: Directory to store the extracted content.

## Bindings:

- `Up`: Repeat the current subtitle.
- `Down`: Toggle subtitles.
- `Left`: Jump to the previous subtitle.
- `Right`: Play (you can spam it, as it does not pause).
- `Enter`: Extract audio and subtitles.

This script automatically pauses the video at the end of each subtitle.
